# Ethereum Commonwealth smart-contract audit DAO.

NOTE: This is the very first implementation. It requires more testing/debugging before use.

The following describes a structure and workflow of Ethereum Commonwealth ETC & CLO smart-contract auditing department. ( read [Callisto whitepaper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16sW_0YajCedBdLvr9jmgJqE9L-SzuYKq/view) for more information )

## Abstract

Smart-contract security is critical for most blockchain DApp development platforms. The main goal of this organization is to improve the security of Ethereum Classic and Callisto ecosystem by providing free security audits for smart-contract developers.

We do not rely on blockchain technology to verify smart-contracts. We only use it to provide a registry of audited contracts, publish and manage **results** of smart-contract audits.

It should be noted that smart-contract auditing organization is scalable which means that it allows to hire, manage and pay security audits of any smart-contracts written in any language depending on demand.

## Structure

There are two types of participants in the described organization: [managers](https://github.com/Dexaran/Security-DAO/blob/master/SecurityDAO.sol#L17) and [auditors](https://github.com/Dexaran/Security-DAO/blob/master/SecurityDAO.sol#L11-L18).
